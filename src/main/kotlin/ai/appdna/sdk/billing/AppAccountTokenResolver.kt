/**
 * Resolves a deterministic [UUID] for use as Google Play Billing's
 * `BillingFlowParams.setObfuscatedAccountId` value (Android's equivalent of
 * Apple's `Transaction.appAccountToken`), keyed off the host-supplied user
 * identity (`AppDNA.identify(userId:)`).
 *
 * Why this exists — the cross-account-entitlement-leak fix:
 *   `BillingClient.queryPurchasesAsync` is **device-scoped** (tied to the
 *   Google account on the device), not app-user-scoped. If user A buys a
 *   subscription, logs out, and user B logs in on the same device, the next
 *   `queryPurchasesAsync` still returns A's purchase — granting B a "fake
 *   premium" state.
 *
 *   `obfuscatedAccountId` is exactly the hook to bind a purchase to an app
 *   user: set on `launchBillingFlow`, read back via
 *   `Purchase.getAccountIdentifiers().getObfuscatedAccountId()` on every
 *   subsequent purchase query, and surfaced to RTDN webhooks so the binding
 *   survives renewals.
 *
 * What this resolver returns — see Sources/AppDNASDK/Billing/AppAccountTokenResolver.swift
 * for the iOS counterpart. The algorithm MUST match byte-for-byte so a user
 * who is identified on both platforms hashes to the same UUID server-side.
 *
 * Determinism contract — the server-side receipt-verifier MUST be able to
 * reproduce the same mapping from `userId` to UUID independently. The
 * algorithm is:
 *   1. If `userId` already parses as a UUID, return it as-is.
 *   2. Otherwise SHA-256(NAMESPACE_UUID_BYTES || userId.utf8), take the first
 *      16 bytes, force RFC-4122 version=5 (name-based, SHA-1) + variant
 *      bits, return as UUID.
 * (Note: RFC-4122 v5 strictly uses SHA-1; we use SHA-256-truncated for
 * stronger collision resistance — the version/variant nibble overrides keep
 * the UUID syntactically valid. The server uses the same algorithm.)
