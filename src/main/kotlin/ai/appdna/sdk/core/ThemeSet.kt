/**
 * SPEC-205 / SPEC-070-A D.1: Theme variants for light / dark mode.
 *
 * Generic wrapper that allows ANY theme-shaped data class to be specified
 * either as a flat object (legacy — treated as light) or as a
 * light/dark pair. The [light] variant is the complete baseline and is
 * required; [dark] is optional sparse overrides that merge on top of
 * light at render time — any field not set in dark falls back to the
 * light value (mirrors iOS asset catalogs' "Dark Appearance" pattern).
 *
 * Resolution happens at render time via Compose's
 * `androidx.compose.foundation.isSystemInDarkTheme()` so the SDK
 * auto-adapts when the user toggles system dark mode.
 *
 * Back-compat: legacy messages / surveys that stored a flat theme
 * object are decoded into [light] with [dark] = null. No migration
 * needed on existing customer data.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `Core/ThemeSet.swift`.
