 * SPEC-070-B PN row 16 (W12) — how many host vetoes have timed out and silently fallen back to
 * their default. A timed-out `onPromoCodeSubmit` drops a sale; a timed-out `shouldShowMessage`
 * bypasses the host's guard. Neither is visible today, which is why the counter exists at all.
 * Surfaced through `diagnose()`; incremented by the wrapper's veto timer.
