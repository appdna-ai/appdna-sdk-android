/**
 * SPEC-070-B — the onboarding flow-completion seam.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: "the flow finished" is the single most important event onboarding emits —
 * it is the denominator of the whole funnel and the only moment the host is handed the user's
 * answers. On Android it was reachable ONLY through `OnboardingFlowManager.present(activity, ...)`:
 * the event track, the response persistence and `onOnboardingCompleted` all lived inside a lambda
 * that `present()` closes over, so nothing without an `Activity` — no unit test, no cross-platform
 * fixture, no future host-driven presentation path — could reach the completion decision or prove
 * it fired. [OnboardingAdvance] had already been extracted for exactly this reason and returns
 * `Navigation.CompleteFlow`; this is the other half of that seam: what the SDK must DO when it
 * gets one.
 *
 * THE CROSS-PLATFORM CONTRACT (read off iOS, not invented here):
 *  - event `onboarding_flow_completed`, props `{flow_id, total_steps, total_duration_ms, responses}`
 *    — iOS `Onboarding/OnboardingFlowManager.swift:104-110`. Android already emitted this exact
 *    name and prop set; the bug was reachability, not naming, so nothing is renamed.
 *  - delegate `onOnboardingCompleted(flowId, responses)` — iOS `OnboardingFlowManager.swift:112`,
 *    Android [AppDNAOnboardingDelegate.onOnboardingCompleted].
 *  - responses are persisted to the session store first (SPEC-088), so a host reacting inside
 *    `onOnboardingCompleted` already sees them.
 *
 * NOT `flow_completed`: that name belongs to the SCREENS module
 * (`ScreenManager` — iOS `Screens/ScreenManager.swift:232`, Android `ScreenManager.kt`), which
 * emits `flow_completed` / `flow_abandoned` for screen flows. Neither platform has ever emitted it
 * for onboarding, and reusing it would silently merge two different funnels in the warehouse.

     * The event the SDK MUST emit when an onboarding flow completes. A constant, not a literal at

     * delegate throws.
