/**
 * SPEC-070-A J.21 — survives Activity recreation (config changes / process
 * death-then-restore) without leaking pre-launch state across distinct flow
 * launches.
 *
 * Holds everything that previously lived in `OnboardingActivity.companion
 * object` static fields:
 *   - the [AppDNAOnboardingDelegate] reference,
 *   - the [OnboardingFlowConfig] under presentation,
 *   - the [EventTracker] handle,
 *   - the 5 lambda hooks (`onStepViewed`, `onStepCompleted`, `onStepSkipped`,
 *     `onFlowCompleted`, `onFlowDismissed`),
 *   - the live `currentStepIndex` + `responses` map driving the Compose host,
 *   - the `restoredStepIndex` / `restoredResponses` snapshot read by
 *     [onSaveInstanceState] on rotation / process death.
 *
 * Cross-launch isolation: each [OnboardingActivity] launch acquires its own
 * [androidx.lifecycle.ViewModelStore] (the Activity instance is its own
 * `ViewModelStoreOwner`), so a brand-new launch starts from a freshly
 * constructed [OnboardingViewModel] — there is no carryover from a previous
 * flow. The same-Activity re-launch path (which AppDNA never triggers — every
 * `presentOnboarding(...)` builds a new Intent + new Activity) would call
 * [reset] explicitly.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `OnboardingFlowHost.swift` `@SceneStorage` round-trip + iOS
 * `OnboardingRenderer` instance-scoped delegate retention.
