/**
 * SPEC-070-B — the decision seam for a `permission` CTA.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the permission action had NO observable seam on Android. The whole
 * behavior lived in `runPermissionPipeline()`, a closure inside `@Composable OnboardingFlowHost`
 * that read the type straight out of `layout.permission_type` and went off to talk to the OS. Two
 * consequences:
 *
 *  1. The host could not observe that a permission element had been ACTED ON at all. Every other
 *     button on a step emits `{action, action_value, ...inputValues}` through `onNext` — which is
 *     what `onBeforeStepAdvance` receives, and what the cross-platform fixtures call `onAction`
 *     (see [emitAuthAction]). The permission button emitted nothing, so a host that wanted to log,
 *     branch on, or A/B the permission ask had no callback to hang it on. iOS's `handleBlockAction`
 *     (`OnboardingRenderer.swift` `case "permission"`) routes the tap through the same
 *     action-dispatch surface as every other CTA; Android didn't.
 *
 *  2. The SAFE FALLBACK — an unsupported / unauthorable permission type must still ADVANCE rather
 *     than dead-end the flow on a button that does nothing — was unreachable from a unit test, so
 *     nothing proved it. A dead CTA in an onboarding flow is a total funnel stop.
 *
 * The decision (which type, is it actionable, do we prompt or advance) is now pure and lives here.
 * The OS work (status, prompt, settings fallback) stays in the composable, which is the only place
 * that can own an `ActivityResultLauncher`.
 */

/**
 * The action string a permission CTA reports to the host. Matches iOS

 * On the [PermissionActionDecision.SafeFallbackAdvance] path the emission IS the advance (onNext
 * completes the step), so an unsupported permission can never strand the user. On the
