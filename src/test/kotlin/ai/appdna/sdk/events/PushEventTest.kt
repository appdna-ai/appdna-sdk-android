/**
 * SPEC-070-A J.8 — PushEventTest.
 *
 * Mirrors `Tests/AppDNASDKTests/PushEventTests.swift`. Validates that the
 * three SDK-emitted push event names match the iOS source-of-truth and
 * that the delegate fan-out wiring round-trips a [PushPayload] correctly.
 *
 * NOTE: Real `AppDNA.trackPushDelivered` / `.trackPushTapped` would require
 * an Android Context to instantiate `EventQueue`. This test instead asserts
 * the public name constants + delegate contract — the wiring sites in
 * `AppDNA.kt` and `AppDNAMessagingService.kt` are exercised by
 * `Spec070AEventEnvelopeTest`.
