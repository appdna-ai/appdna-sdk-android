/**
 * SPEC-070-A J.8 — a paywall opened from an onboarding step must forward EVERY lifecycle callback to
 * the host's registered paywall delegate. A host that wires analytics onto `AppDNA.paywall.listener`
 * and then opens a paywall mid-onboarding must not silently get a hole in its funnel.
 *
 * 🔴 THIS TEST ASSERTED NOTHING, TWICE OVER.
 *
 *   1. It was `@Ignore`d, justified as "bridge verified live on every commit via Mac build bridge".
 *      Nothing verifies it on every commit. It simply never ran.
 *   2. Un-ignoring it would not have helped: it declared its own `ForwardingPaywallBridge` INSIDE the
 *      test file and asserted that the hand-written mirror forwarded 13 callbacks. Its own doc comment
 *      conceded the consequence — "if the live forwarder drops a callback this test will not catch it
 *      directly." The production class was never touched.
 *
 * It drives the REAL [OnboardingPaywallBridge] now. That class takes three lambdas and was always
 * constructible; the only thing standing in the way was `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())`, and
 * Robolectric has had a main looper the whole time.
