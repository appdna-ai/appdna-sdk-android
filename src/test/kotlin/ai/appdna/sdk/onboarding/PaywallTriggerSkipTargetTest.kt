/**
 * SPEC-403 — paywall_trigger skip-target resolver chain tests (Android).
 *
 * Mirrors the iOS [PaywallTriggerSkipTargetTests] file. The actual resolver
 * lives inside `presentPaywallTriggerNode` (OnboardingActivity.kt:~814)
 * wired into a `routeOutcome` lambda. Test exercises the pure resolver
 * chain that mirrors:
 *
 *     routeOutcome(onSubscribedSkipTarget ?: onSuccessTarget,
 *                  "continue", "user_already_subscribed")
 *
 * End-to-end behavior is covered by the shared behavioral fixtures at
 * `packages/sdk-shared-fixtures/billing/` loaded by [SharedFixtureTest].
